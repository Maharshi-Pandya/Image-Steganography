Take the input text and convert it into binary.

Eg.
    "Hello World! ðŸ’Ÿ" => "0100100001100101011011000110110001101111001000000101011101101111011100100110110001100100001000010010000011110000100111111001001010011111"

yeah its long ik...its binary what do u expect

So after converting to binary, take each byte(8 bits) from it, convert the byte to
uint8 and set the blue channel as that byte.

Encoding doneee!
